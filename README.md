This is a data cleaning project in SQL.
The dataset is taken from github and initially posted on kaggle which was later modified and uploaded on github. 
I have modified the dataset a little bit on excel and dowloaded in csv before using it on SQL. I have uploaded the modified CSV file which can be directly used in MSSQL or MYSQL Workbench.
In this dataset we have details of the houses that were being sold in nashville,tennesse in a particular time period. In this project I have taken that data and cleaned it by removing duplicates and unwaned column, spliting the addresses into separate columns and changing the date format.
